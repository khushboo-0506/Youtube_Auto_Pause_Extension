# Youtube_Auto_Pause_Extension

This is a Chrome extension that pauses Youtube videos when losing the tab/window focus by sending events to the player. Resumes the playback once the Youtube tab/window is back in focus.

Also listens for computer lock events and when the video goes out of viewport (for example when reading comments below the video).

Features some useful keyboard shortcuts to control videos in the window.
